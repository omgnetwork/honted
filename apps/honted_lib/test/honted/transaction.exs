  This test could test the stateless features of the transaction validation etc.
  For now this functionality _is tested_ but via its application in honted (abci_test).
  This is the mission critical application of the transaction validation functionality, and seems natural there

  Since, from the point of view of Lib's and API's API, it is only a convenience functionality, let's postpone handling
  this testing independently from ABCI

  FIXME: implement these tests (:troll:)
